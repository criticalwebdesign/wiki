## Context 

Chapter 4 introduces readers to grid-based design, starting with a historical overview of the use of grids in printing with moveable type and concluding with grids for responsive design. The modules put this context into practice, introducing frames and layout grids for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices in Figma, discussing content hierarchy using display and body type, and coding a simple responsive layout with the Bootstrap framework using lorem ipsum placeholder text to work across all devices.

Figure 4.11 Jan Diehm’s design for The Pudding’s “Does Data Die?” incorporates an interactive grid and explosive image boxes that follow the cursor as the viewer scrolls through the article. The text consistently flows in an easy to read, high contrast single column on the right while graphics animate throughout the page. Just as pixels combine to form an image, the reader combines these elements to understand the history of Lenna's image. Read and interact with this piece at https://pudding.cool/2021/10/lenna/
