Introduction to the book

![alt text](images/00/00-01-clickclickclick.png) 
The website, [clickclickclick.click](https://clickclickclick.click) is an example of critical web design. It presents a simple button when it loads. Then a recorded voice and text in the interface slowly informs the user that their actions are not only being recorded, but measured, scored, and represented as achievements.
