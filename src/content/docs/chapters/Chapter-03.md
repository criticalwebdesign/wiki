## Context 

Chapter 3 includes a contextual discussion of critical design and culture jamming to initiate a prompt for readers to create their own subversive logo redesign. The resulting web page allows viewers to hover over an image in the page and watch it change to its subversive form. Modules show how to use custom fonts via Google Fonts and incorporate additional styling through CSS.

### Exercise 3.1.2 Figma Basics

Create a free Figma account before starting this exercise. As software tools like Figma can change often, we encourage you to explore their onboarding tutorials to learn the basics. Below are the essential steps and concepts for beginning a layout design in Figma.

1. Open and login to Figma either in a web browser https://figma.com or by downloading and installing their client. 
2. Create a new Figma file. Figma organizes files inside projects, which are further organized under teams. Figma is cloud-based (files are stored on their server), which allows you to collaborate by adding other users to your team. 
3. You will see a blank Canvas. This is the backdrop where you will add frames containing your designs.
4. Explore the options in the File menu at the top left of the window. Select the Frame tool. Create a new Frame by selecting the Desktop (1440x1024) preset (among others for mobile, tablet, and even paper sizes) from the menu on the right. Like Artboards in Photoshop or Illustrator, Frames in Figma organize and define the dimensions for each composition you create.
5. We are creating a spoof of an IKEA advertisement in this example, so we will sample colors from their website. Create a screenshot from https://ikea.com and place the image file in your Figma composition by navigating to the Main Menu > File > Place Image. Alternatively, you can copy and paste or drag the image to your Figma canvas. 
6. Set the background color of the frame to match the yellow in the company’s brand. Select the frame and click on the color chip in the Fill area of the right side panel. Use the eyedropper to select the yellow color in the IKEA logo (Figure 3.11). It is simple to copy the hexadecimal or RGB color values from Figma to your CSS file. 

![A screenshot showing how to use the eyedropper tool to select a color in a graphic.](images/03/03-11-sampleIkeaYellowFigma.png)
Figure 3.11 Use the eyedropper to find the CSS, RGB, or Hex values of colors in Figma. 

7. Select the Rectangle tool from the Shapes drop down (Figure 3.12) and draw a box to hold space for the image on the page. Our design only includes one image that changes on mouse interaction. For this mock-up we simply need to suggest roughly where that image should appear on the page (Figure 3.13).

![The Rectangle tool selected in Figma.](images/03/03-12-Figma%20shape%20menu.png)
Figure 3.12 The Figma Shapes menu.


![Screenshot of our Figma file with a yellow background and a gray square.](images/03/03-13-addImagePlaceholder.png)
Figure 3.13 Continue to build a mock-up that loosely shows where elements are placed in the composition. We used the Rectangle tool to draw a placeholder for the image that appears towards the top center of the web page.


8. Figma, like other design applications, uses standard key commands for essential operations. Explore the key commands in the menus like undo (Cmd+Z), redo (Cmd+Shift+Z), copy (`Cmd+c`), and paste (`Cmd+v`) while experimenting as needed. 
9. Notice that you can see the image of your rectangle on the canvas as well as the layer for your new vector shape in the vertical panel on the left side of the screen. As you add more shapes you can organize these layers by dragging them above or below each other in the panel, or select multiple layers by holding the Shift key. Layers can be grouped together by pressing Cmd+G.
10. Press the “v” key to switch to the Move tool and click once to select your rectangle. In the Design panel (on the right) you can now see the properties of the object you selected. Experiment with this panel by changing the shape’s color, stroke, and other properties. 
11. Use the Type tool to position type on the page. Pay attention to the weight of the font (Regular, semi-bold, bold, and so on) and color of the typography, but don’t think too much about the typeface yet. For now, select Arial or any sans serif font from the list. You will learn more about typography in the next section of this module. Remember, you are constructing a mock-up and not a final design (Figure 3.14). 



![screenshot of our Figma file](images/03/03-14-EverythingYouNeedMockup.png)
Figure 3.14 This screenshot of our Figma file shows a rough sketch of the web page we will construct in the next modules. The image is not yet selected or made, nor has the typeface has not yet been selected. However, you can begin to see the colors included in the design, the placement of design elements on the page, and how the eye might move across the compositional space. 




![Screenshot of mockup design](images/03/03-15-ikeaMockups.png)
Figure 3.15 This layout shows a screenshot of an original advertisement (left) with mock-up images showing how the company name and graphics might change when the user interacts with the page. Notice that the typeface for the company does not match the original (we’ll discuss that in the next section), but the background color and overall layout helps convey the similarities between the original and its transformation.

### Color in the Browser

As you can see in the case study, color is an essential part of the brand identity. Color enabled xtine's project to reference the original while adding additional information to transform it into a form of commentary.

A color model explains how colors interact. The colors you see when you print a document or mix paint come from light reflecting off the pigments. As you add more pigments to a material (like paper or canvas) it becomes darker, even muddy. Thus the four primary pigments in CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black) printer ink is an example of the subtractive color model. 

Alternately, in the additive color model used by computer screens and digital cameras, light is mixed together, rather than pigments, to produce the color humans perceive. Additive color is based on 256 possible values for each channel in the RGB (red, green, and blue) color space. Computers store and use binary data so these values range from 0-255, which can be seen in Table 3.1. Increasing the values in each channel results in colors that appear lighter. For example, when all three are set to the maximum amount of light (255, 255, 255), the result is white, while 0, 0, 0 is black. 

The hexadecimal number system is another popular way to denote colors in CSS. Each character in the hexadecimal system uses 16 possible values, from 0-9, followed by alphabetic characters A-F. With hexadecimal color, characters 1-2 represent red, 3-4 are green, and 5-6 are blue. 

![Color values](images/03/03-10-color-models.png)
Color values expressed in RGB, Hex, and CSS. Each rule in the CSS column will create the same color in the browser.

The colors discussed so far are all opaque. To control transparency of your color you can add a fourth alpha channel to the RGB colors. To do this in CSS use either the rgba() function (the fourth channel is a value from 0-1) or the HEXA notation which adds a 7th and 8th character to your hexadecimal color values.

```css
.red50pct { color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); }
.red50pct { color: #ff000080; }
```

There are many websites where you can see the relationship between these, including color palette generators like https://rgbacolorpicker.com





### Exercise 3.1.4 Choose a Matching Typeface

With typeface fundamentals in mind, select a typeface that matches the IKEA identity and incorporate it into your design.

1. If your logo includes letters, upload it to What the Font https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont to discover similar typefaces. You do not have to purchase a typeface. Instead, you can just use the tool to observe the results, leading you to find a typeface appropriate for your project. 
1. Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com hosts a series of typefaces made for display on the web. Browse by categories, filter for serif or sans-serif fonts, and preview the font in whatever text you type into the box. Once you find a matching font, click to see its specimen page. Beneath the preview area, select the font by pressing the Select button (the plus) on the right side of the preview. The Selected family menu appears on the right side of the browser. If it doesn't appear then click on the icon on the top right of the window. You should select several fonts and display them together so you can make a visual comparison as Owen did in his Monopoly project (Figure 3.19). 
1. Sometimes you can find information about an organization's font using a Web search. Search Google for "IKEA logo font". Often organizations will start with a particular font and modify it to make it hard to copy or better match their identity. Identities also evolve, as you will find with IKEA. The font we chose (and you will download and use in Exercise 3.3.1) was Futura Press. You will also find IKEA Logo Font on dafont.com, which would be viable.

### Exercise: Add An External Stylesheet

Follow the steps to add a CSS file, saving and refreshing your work in the browser each time.

1. In Codespaces, right click on the left panel under the view-source/ folder, and select New file… from the context menu. A box will appear to name the file. If you type a path with forward slashes in this box before the filename (and you didn't already create the assets and css folders in Exercise 1.3.1) VS Code will automatically create the folder hierarchy with those folders. Type the following and press return to make VS Code make a new folder named assets, which contains a new folder named css, which contains a new file named styles.css. You could have also done this using several individual steps, but this is faster. 

```css
assets/css/styles.css
```

2. Open the new CSS file, type the following rules, and save it. Like HTML, you can use whitespace as you like in CSS to make contents readable.
body { color: purple; }

```css
h1 {
	color: red;
font-weight: bold;
}
```

3. Now that you have an external stylesheet, you'll need to link to it from HTML before your styles will be applied. Until you complete this step, you simply have two files that are unaware of one another. Add the link tag in the index.html file, after the <title> element, but before the closing </head> of the document. If you’re writing in VS Code, the tag is:

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css">
```

4. The link tag tells the browser to also fetch this other document when it loads the page. The rel attribute defines the relationship between the HTML and CSS files and the href attribute is the path to the CSS file. Add the following paragraph tags to help test the CSS:

```html
<p>A paragraph</p>
<p>A paragraph</p>
<p>A paragraph</p>
```

5. Save and view your work in the browser. If you followed the instructions, all your paths are correct, and your documents are saved, you should see a red h1 and purple paragraphs. 







## 3.3 Web Fonts & Javascript Events


### 3.3.1 Using Custom Fonts on the Web

Computers display text by matching each character’s unique codepoint (see Unicode discussion in Module 2.2) to its corresponding glyph, or visual representation of a character, in a given font file. For example, U+0041 is the codepoint for the Latin capital “A”. To display this character on the screen in a specific font each users’ computer needs to access the typeface file containing the glyphs for all the codepoints. If the font is not accessible the text will be displayed in some other (potentially undesirable) default font. It is also possible that a codepoint may not exist in a font because it does not contain characters for a given human language. In this case the character itself will be substituted with a default character.

Nowadays, designers have access to many more typeface options using the CSS @font-face rule that makes it possible to link to a custom font just as you would an image or any other page resource. There are many font MIME types that can be used with @font-face like TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF), but the Web Open Font Format (WOFF) and WOFF2 (the next generation) formats offer the best compression and support across browsers. See the wiki for instructions to use the @font-face rule.  




### Exercise 3.3.1 Use @font-face to Add Custom Fonts

In this exercise you will use @font-face to style text on your page using a custom typeface. The font that we are using is called Futura Press, which we found online with a search for “font used in IKEA logo.” In your own work, you might use a Google Web Font or another custom font that you will download and possibly convert to WOFF format. 

1. Open the index page, critical-design/index.html in Chrome and use DevTools to inspect the text on the page. 
2. Find the CSS rule for the body element and examine the font-family declaration. Notice it sets the font to Helvetica, then “falls back” to Arial, and finally defaults to any sans-serif font. Helvetica requires a fee to license so you likely do not have it installed on your system (the sidebar explains how to see installed fonts), so you are actually viewing Arial (which looks very similar). 
3. To add a CSS rule to change the font for the word “TIME” to the Futura Press typeface identified above you will need to add the font file to your project and link it from the CSS file. Download the TTF (TrueType font) file from https://www.wfonts.com/font/futura-press and add this file as an asset. If you’re using VS Code, place it next to your CSS file in: critical-design/assets/css/ 
4. To ensure the font can be viewed on every device it is best to add a WOFF or WOFF2 format. You can convert it using one of many online tools like https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff and save the converted file next to the TTF file.
5. Add the following @font-face rule to your stylesheet right before the h2 rule. Adjust the filename as needed. Browsers will choose the first supported font from the prioritized list in the src declaration. 

```css
@font-face {
font-family: "Futura Press";
src: url(FUTURAPR.woff) format("woff"),
     url(FUTURAPR.ttf)  format("truetype");
}
```

6. Now that the font is referenced and available, update the h2 CSS rule to use it. Notice we also list Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif as fall-back fonts.

```css
h2 {
font-family: "Futura Press", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

7. You may need to use a “hard refresh” before you see the font change (see the Best Practices sidebar).

Figure 3.26 Select and use custom typefaces in your design with Google Fonts.



![Diagram of a Javascript variable declaration. ](images/03/03-27-javascript-variable.pdf)
Figure 3.27 This code creates a new variable called greeting, and assigns a string of text as the value. 





### Exercise 3.3.4 Import a Javascript file into HTML

Link to direct an external Javascript file to the HTML document.

1. In VS Code, create a new file called main.js at the following path

```
critical-design/assets/js/main.js
```

2. Add this code to main.js to log a message to the console. Save the file. 

```js
console.log("Hello from main.js");
```

3. Before you can see this message in your web page you need to embed the Javascript file in the HTML document using the <script> element. VS Code users should open critical-design/index.html and add the following element just before the closing </body> tag, so the code executes after the document has loaded. 

```html
<script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>
```

4. Save index.html and preview your work in Chrome. Open the DevTools Console (be sure to navigate to the Console) to confirm the message appears.



![Javascript event listener diagram shows the path from user to event to listener to handler.](images/03/03-28-JS-event-handlers.png)
Figure 3.28 An event can be initiated by a user (e.g. click, keypress, mouseover, mouseout, scroll, etc.) or something happening on the web page (like when it finishes loading or catches an error). An event listener “listens” for the event to happen, then calls an event handler which runs code in response to the event. Much of the time “listener” and “handler” are interchangeable, since they need to work together to respond to events.




![xxxxx](images/03/03-29-devtools.png)
Figure 3.29 DevTools will highlight a target element if you hover over the line in the Console. This can be handy for debugging when you need to confirm that a selector is working.
ALT: Screenshot of DevTools highlighting a target element when the mouse is hovering over the line in the Console.



```js
let targetElement = document.querySelector("h2");

targetElement.addEventListener("mouseover", function(){
		console.log("Hello!");
	}
);
```

![eventlistener](images/03/03-30-js-eventlistener-anatomy.png)
Figure 3.30 This code shows how to add a click event listener in Javascript. Line 1 creates a new variable to store a reference to the target element. Line 3 attaches an event listener to the target element, designating "mouseover" as the name of the event to listen for. Line 4 is the event handler function that wraps code to run when the event occurs. Note that sometimes the format may be different, since Javascript doesn’t care about whitespace as long as the syntax is correct.
