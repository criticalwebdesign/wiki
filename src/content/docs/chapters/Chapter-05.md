## Context 

In Chapter 5 we introduce foundational design principles for usability, including focus, contrast and negative space. We demonstrate how to create a usability test for a website, deliver the test, and reflect on the outcomes. The prompt for this chapter has students create their own usability test using professional standards and methods, implement this test with a friend or colleague, and design and code a responsive webpage containing their reflections on the outcomes with recommendations for the site owner.

Figure 5.3 The common stages of a design thinking process are represented most often as a series of iterative loops that inform each other to improve your outcomes.

Each company has to communicate bikes by intended terrain, wheel size, frame material, suspension, weight, etc. using menus, filters, images, quizzes, information hierarchy, and other methods for all the different bikes on their sites.

Figure 5.5 Alexei Shulgin, Form Art, 1997 (https://www.c3.hu/collection/form) presents various functioning form elements, including inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes. When clicked, scrolled, or checked, the elements animate, provide context, or link to new pages in a continuous narrative of virtual paperwork. You can interact with the project here https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/form-art.html as it was originally published using a browser emulator.

Figure 5.8 This graphic shows the flow, state, logic, and events of a program that “turns a lamp on or off.” The logic (decisions the computer makes) is based on the state (the status of variables in the program) and events (e.g. user input) directing the computer towards its goal.

Figure 5.11 It is a good practice to create design and prototype iterations separately before merging them together, as we show in this "iterative design/prototype flowchart". This makes it easier to create and edit designs in Figma that echo and imagine the work you do in your prototype. Equally, keeping the prototype free of design code will simplify your testing and iterations. After multiple iterations you can bring them together into the final coded version of your project.
